# Vector Selection Sort C++
This program sorts a list of integers (vector) using a selection sort algorithm.
It takes input from the user through the keyboard until a non-numeric character is entered,
it then shows the user all the numbers in the order they were entered and finally it shows
all the numbers sorted from low to high.
